    <h3>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.</h3>
    <p>Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure that
        the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up in
        the kitchen.<br>
         These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you
        have everything ready to go!
