    <h1>Smash Burger</h1>
    <img src="../images/burger.jpeg" alt="Smash Burger">
    <h3>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges.</h3>
    <p>Don't use meat that is leaner than 80/20 for best results, and make sure that
        the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to avoid smoking up in
        the kitchen.<br>
         These grill up <strong>very fast</strong> because of the high heat, so make sure you
        have everything ready to go!

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Hamburger Buns</li>
        <li>1 LBS of Ground Beef</li>
        <li>4 6-inch square parchement paper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>4 Slices of American cheese</li>
        <li>Burger topping of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron 
            flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>
        <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, 
            as this will prevent it from smashing properly.</li>
        <li>Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment and immediately smash down to a 
            1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down.</li>
        <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper 
            or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 
            15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun 
            and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ol>
