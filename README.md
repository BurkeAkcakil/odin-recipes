First TOP Project, HTML Recipe Website

Hi! This is honestly my first project. As small as it may be, I am really excited to build a small basic HTML Recipe Webpage. I have no clue if anyone will see this on GitHub as I am really new to both the platform & programming, but if you do; please feel free to comment on what I can improve!

Final Thoughts:

Main page with an image, title as well as a list of the links to the recipe to make it look more organized.
Lists for recipes, for both the steps and ingredients.
Added alt text, to make it more disability friendly, and in case the image doesn't load.
This was really fun and I can't wait till I learn more.
